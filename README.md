# employee-management-system

An easy to use system to manage employees for HR clerks. 

Created by Ningsong and Janakitti

## Usage

To keep track of the employees and their information in a company. 

Currently, there is no application. To help out, please clone the repository and open with Java (IDEs work fine). Requires Java 7. (I think) Run the mainframe.java

## Design

Uses tabbed panels to seperate the various functions and a menu bar at the top. Native system UI.

## Functions

Add Employees
Remove Employees
Edit Employees
Search for Employees
View all Employees
Company Statistics
+ more!

## Tutorial

Is available in the help menu, but it's really simple so everyone should be able to use it.

## Comment Deserts
There are places in the code where there are no/inadequate comments.

Plus, there are many empty methods that should be deleted.
